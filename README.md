## 🚀 Workflow: Step-by-Step Usage

The analysis is divided into a series of notebooks that should be run in order. Before running, place your raw data files in the `data/` directory.

### Step 0: `00_chembl_data_preparation.ipynb` 

**Purpose:** To clean, filter, and standardize a raw dataset from ChEMBL, making it suitable for modeling.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  In the **Configuration** cell, set the path to your raw input file.
3.  Run all cells (`Cell` > `Run All`).
4.  A cleaned CSV file will be saved in the `results/` directory.

### Step 1: QSAR ML Model building (External Step)

This step is performed outside of this repository. Use the CSV file with cleaned data to build your QSAR ML models through QSARtuna as described in Supplementary Information Section 2.


### Step 2: `01_kmeans_sampler.ipynb`

**Purpose:** To generate the weight configurations that will guide the generative AI.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  Adjust parameters like `N_OBJECTIVES` and `N_CLUSTERS` in the **Configuration** cell if needed.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  The output `01_weights.csv` will be saved in the `results/` directory.


### Step 3: Run the Generative AI (External Step)

Use the `01_weights.csv` file generated in the previous step to run your multi-objective REINVENT jobs as described in the paper. This step is performed outside of this repository. Ensure all run logs and generated molecules are saved for the next analysis step.

### Step 4: `02_pareto_analysis.ipynb`

**Purpose:** To analyze the results from the generative runs, identify the Pareto front, and calculate performance metrics.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  In the **Configuration** cell, provide the paths to the .csv generated at the end of the REINVENT run.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  Plots comparing Pareto fronts and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the notebook.
