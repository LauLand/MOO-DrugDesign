## 🚀 Workflow: Step-by-Step Usage

The analysis is divided into a series of notebooks that should be run in order. Before running, place your raw data files in the `data/` directory.

### Step 0: `00_chembl_data_preparation.ipynb` (Optional if needed for QSAR ML Classification model building)

**Purpose:** To clean, filter, and standardize a raw dataset from ChEMBL, making it suitable for modeling.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  In the **Configuration** cell, set the path to your raw input file.
3.  Run all cells (`Cell` > `Run All`).
4.  A cleaned CSV file will be saved in the `results/` directory.

### Step 1: `01_kmeans_sampler.ipynb`

**Purpose:** To generate the objective weight configurations that will guide the generative AI.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  Adjust parameters like `N_OBJECTIVES` and `N_CLUSTERS` in the **Configuration** cell if needed.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  The output `01_weights.csv` will be saved in the `results/` directory.


### Step 2: Run the Generative AI (External Step)

Use the `01_weights.csv` file generated in the previous step to run your multi-objective REINVENT jobs as described in the paper. This step is performed outside of this repository. Ensure all run logs and generated molecules are saved for the next analysis step.

### Step 3: `02_pareto_analysis.ipynb`

**Purpose:** To analyze the results from the generative runs, identify the Pareto front, and calculate performance metrics.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  In the **Configuration** cell, provide the paths to your method's results file and the baseline's results file.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  A plot comparing the Pareto fronts and a CSV of the non-dominated solutions will be saved in `results/`.


### Step 4: `04_downstream_filtering.ipynb`

**Purpose:** To apply final medicinal chemistry and property-based filters to the Pareto-optimal solutions to select the most promising candidates.
**Instructions:**
1.  Open the notebook.
2.  The notebook will automatically use the Pareto front CSV from Step 3. You can adjust the filter thresholds in the **Configuration** cell.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  A CSV file with the final list of candidate molecules will be saved in `results/`.
